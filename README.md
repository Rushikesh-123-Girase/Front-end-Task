# Front-end-Task
Project Submission: Cuberto Animation Recreation
1. Sections Implemented
In this project, I chose to implement the following sections from the Cuberto homepage:

Header: A navigation bar that includes links to different sections of the page.
Hero Section: A visually appealing introduction with a background image and a welcoming message.
Services Section: A grid layout showcasing the services offered, with animations for each service card.
Footer: A simple footer with copyright information.
2. Challenges Faced and Solutions
Challenge: Implementing smooth animations using Framer Motion.

Solution: I referred to the Framer Motion documentation to understand how to use the motion component effectively. I experimented with different animation properties (like initial, animate, and transition) to achieve the desired effects.
Challenge: Ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.

Solution: I utilized Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes to create a layout that adapts to various screen sizes. I tested the application on different devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience.
Challenge: Integrating Tailwind CSS with React.

Solution: I followed the official Tailwind CSS installation guide for Create React App, ensuring that the configuration was set up correctly. I also created a separate CSS file for Tailwind directives to keep the styles organized.
3. Technologies Used
React.js: For building the user interface and managing component states.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the components and ensuring a responsive design.
Framer Motion: For adding smooth animations and transitions to the components.
Shadcn UI: (if applicable) For any UI components that enhance the design (not explicitly used in the provided code but can be integrated as needed).
TypeScript: (optional) For type safety and better development experience (not explicitly used in the provided code but can be added).
Conclusion
This project allowed me to practice my frontend development skills, particularly in creating animations and responsive layouts. The use of modern technologies like React and Tailwind CSS made the development process efficient and enjoyable.
